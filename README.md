# **Code structure**:
Here is a brief explanation of the code structure in this repository, organized into the Dataset, LLM, and NER folders:

## ***Dataset***
This folder contains the code for generating the training dataset, cleaning it, and converting it from CSV to JSON format.

### No_PHI_Dataset_Generation.py
Script used to create a synthetic dataset of doctor-patient dialogues NOT containing PHI (Protected health information).

### PHI_Dataset_Generation.py
Script used to create a synthetic dataset of doctor-patient dialogues containing PHI.

### create_json.ipynb
This script was used to convert the previously created CSV file into a JSON file suitable for training the NER model. The resulting JSON contains tokenized text and a BIO label for each token, following the format required by the model.

### uniq_clean_dataset.py
Script used to mitigate errors produced by the LLAMA-8B model during dataset generation.

## ***LLM***

The LLM folder contains the Python files that allow training and testing of the LLM model, which detects the presence or absence of PHI in a text segment.

```bash

│   │   ├── ClinicalT5_ModelTrainer.py
│   │   ├── data_handler.py

    │   └── pii_data_loader.py
    ├── testing_clinicalT5-base.py
    └── training_clinicalT5-base.py
```
Benchmark folder contains scripts used for the benchmarks of the models, in particular for ClinicalT5, on a generated dataset. In 'balanced_and_imbalanced_training' there are the same scripts modified in order to train ClinicalT5 model on two dataset: by setting appropriately the METHODOLOGY variable, the training can be done by taking the 75% of the two dataset (imbalanced), or 750 samples from both dataset (imbalanced). 

### ClinicalT5_ModelTrainer.py
Contains the training, testing, and inference methods for the ClinicalT5 model. In particular, it also includes the method for plotting the ROC curve during testing.

### data_handler.py
Defines data handling during the training and testing phases, in particular dataset loading, cleaning, and splitting.

### pii_data_loader.py
Manages and tokenizes the datasets, from which it creates DataLoaders for training.

### training_clinicalT5-base.py
Trains the ClinicalT5 model on a dataset containing PHI and PII. For usage, consider the following options:

- Training strategy
   -b/--standard &emsp;train-validation-test split 
  
- -n/--num_splits &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of  splits
- -e/--num_epochs &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of epoch
- --dataset &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Path of dataset.

Example

```bash
python3 training_clinicalT5-base.py -s -n 3 -e 5 --dataset datasets/training_dataset.csv --num_labels 2
```


### testing_clinicalT5-base.py
Performs testing of the model created during training. To use it:
```bash
python3 testing_clinicalT5-base.py
```


## ***NER***

### base_config.cfg
Configuration file that defines the hyperparameters, dataset paths, tokenization settings, and training options required to train the NER model.

### spacy-ner-spy.ipynb
Script used to train the NER model.

### test-ner.ipynb
Script used to test the previously trained NER model in order to evaluate its performance on a new test dataset.

### NER_balanced_finetuning.ipynb
Script for fine-tuning a spaCy NER model on a balanced medical dataset. The dataset is split into 1500 training samples and 500 test samples. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

### NER_imbalanced_finetuning.ipynb
Script for fine-tuning a NER model on an imbalanced dataset. This dataset created by sampling 75% of two datasets with very different sizes: one containing approximately 50,000 texts and the other 1,000 texts, thus preserving the strong imbalance between the two sources.



## ***Cascade System***

### cascade_system.ipynb

The script performs three experiments to evaluate the developed LLM + NER system:

**Experiment 1:**
In the first experiment, two strategies for analyzing the dataset are compared. In the first one, the LLM analyzes all the sentences, and the NER is applied only to the sentences that the LLM considers to contain PHI. In the second one, the NER directly analyzes the entire dataset. The objective is to compare the execution times of the two strategies and determine which one is faster.

**Experiment 2:**

In the second experiment, the LLM analyzes the entire dataset, classifying the sentences based on the presence or absence of PHI. Subsequently, the NER is applied only to the sentences that the LLM has classified as not containing PHI. In this way, when the NER identifies PHI entities in one of these sentences, it is possible to recover a False Negative error made by the LLM. The objective is therefore to evaluate how many of the LLM's False Negatives can be recovered through the intervention of the NER.


**Experiment 3:**

In the third experiment, the LLM again analyzes the entire dataset, but this time the NER is applied only to the sentences that the LLM has classified as containing PHI. If the NER does not identify any PHI entities in one of these sentences, the positive result produced by the LLM is considered a possible False Positive and is therefore eliminated. The objective is to evaluate how many of the False Positives generated by the LLM can be corrected through the NER.
